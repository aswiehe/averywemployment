When creating this site, I wanted to show an intermediate level of skill with HTML, CSS, and javascript. In doing so, it was also important to me to make files as short and simple as possible, so that as you review this site, you’re not overwhelmed and don’t need to spend too long looking around. For that reason, I’ve decided on using Bootstrap. While this site isn’t perfect in terms of design aesthetic, Bootstrap’s built-in CSS classes have made it fairly quick making things look reasonably okay without too much work, while still providing the time and opportunity to show my knowledge of web design in the custom CSS file. It’s also made it much easier to make the site look alright on other devices and browsers. I’m not going to claim that I’ve tested this site as extensively on other browsers as I have on Google Chrome, but I will say that between how I’ve utilized the framework I’m using, a couple one-off media queries, and a little time spent eyeballing different elements, things look and feel reasonably okay regardless of the device the user is on. I’ve used jQuery for a couple small things as well (mostly just to show I have I’m comfortable using it). One helpful thing I’ve used jQuery for is to make AJAX calls to “populate” some of the longer text, thus separating content and form.
