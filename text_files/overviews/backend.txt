The domain this site resides on was purchased from Google Domains. The server itself is a virtual private server being hosted on DigitalOcean. I have other projects that I use DigitalOcean for, and I honestly love it for putting together new ones. When creating new VMs on the virtual private server they provide, DigitalOcean gives you the option to set it up with different pre-configured stacks and technologies. Every time I create a project, I use the base Ubuntu 18 or 20 image, and build from there. Building from scratch keeps me familiar with linux command line, and aside from that, I like knowing exactly what I’ve installed, how things are configured, etc. Without getting too much into detail here, the webserver I’ve installed and configured on this VM is an Apache webserver, and I’ve left pretty much all of the defaults as they are (this is a fairly simple website after all). I’ve configured just this one virtual host, which is serving you the files you're seeing now. It’s running on port 80 (default for HTTP) but it permanently redirects to https://averywemployment.com which runs on port 443. I intend to configure it to run directly on port 443 in the future, but for now, the host itself running on 80 catches all traffic without me having to change things elsewhere. The SSL certificate used by HTTPS was issued by Let’s Encrypt using Certbot.
