The domain this site resides on was purchased from Google Domains. The server itself is a virtual private server being hosted on DigitalOcean. I have other projects that I use DigitalOcean for, and I honestly love it for putting together new projects. When creating a new VMs on the virtual private server, you are given the option of setting it up with different stacks and technologies. Every time I create a project, I use the base Ubuntu 18 or 20 image, and build from there. Building from scratch keeps me familiar with linux command line, and aside from that, I like knowing exactly what I’ve installed, how things are configured, etc. Without getting too much into detail here, the web-server I’ve installed and configured on this VM is apache, and I’ve left pretty much all of the defaults as they are (this is a fairly simple website after all). I’ve configured just this one virtual host, which is serving you the files your seeing. It’s running on port 80 (default for HTTP) but it permanently redirects to https://averywemployment.com which runs on port 443. The SSL certificate used by HTTPS was issued by Let’s Encrypt using Certbot.
