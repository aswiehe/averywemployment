I have helped to create a new night shift with an entirely new crew of employees in one of the eight sections of the building. While I will admit that we are one of the few hubs that have received the new automated sorting machines and much of our volume is a kind of “streamlined” volume, the month of December we are on track to have the best service numbers in the US compared to other “small sort” facilities. I frequently work with plant engineers to address any equipment that needs to be tended to by identifying and describing the problem, and following up on any changes they needed to make as necessary. To be clear, I myself do not do anything with the equipment other than turning it on, turning it off, and cleaning it - however, any time the sorting equipment is down, we are still responsible for meeting our service goals, and it is my responsibility as a operations management supervisor to have the problem addressed as quickly as possible. Clear, succinct, and precise communication with multiple sections of the building via phone and radio is required at all times. Originally, securing this third shift job was meant to allow me to focus more on school and honing my programming and systems administration skills with home projects, as well as allowing me to be there for my family’s remote learning during this pandemic. One unexpected benefit of this position is that I have also had opportunities to lead many diverse kinds of people in a very demanding environment, which has been immensely helpful in improving my ability to communicate and work with people (who sometimes can feel frustrated about situations at first).
