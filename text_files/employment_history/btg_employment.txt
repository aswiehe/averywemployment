I spent time across various sister companies within Blair Technology Group coordinating changes to production and internal systems that were requested by upper management. I was the lead programmer and systems administrator for one of the sister companies before it was indefinitely halted for renovations, and was also the person of contact for ensuring data availability and application uptime for that location. Afterwards, I was placed within a team of programmers at another significantly larger sister company within Blair Technology Group. At times (especially in the beginning of my employment) I would help directly with production, refurbishing computers, printers, and laptops. I greatly valued my time with the company, as it provided a plethora of opportunities to learn everything from computer repair to network infrastructure. For some of the time I was even handling customer service emails regarding their refurbished items. These emails were managed entirely through ecommerce vendors, and that being the case, were reviewed in any circumstances where the customer felt their concerns were not addressed by us. This meant not only being clear and succinct, but also extremely accurate and precise in all communications. While working with the smallest sister company, the one I was originally hired on to work with, my customer service interactions spanned across everything from navigating the BIOS of HP servers, activating operating system product keys, updating drivers, and more.
