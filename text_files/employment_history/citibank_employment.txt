I assisted customers with credit card accounts, requiring a broad understanding of pertinent and very frequently changing industry and company standards and regulations. Significant time was spent on documentation of changes to accounts, interactions with customers, and how time was managed personally in addressing their issues. This sometimes meant having to give information about choices the company made that the customers did not find ideal, but that taught me how to affirm with customers that I was by their side to find the best solution possible. I joined the Citibank team at the very beginning of the rollout of a brand new portfolio. The tools customer service representatives used to manage clients with the new card were unreliable, as was the knowledge hub where information about using those tools and information about the card itself was kept. I successfully kept up to date with that base of knowledge, checked it each day for changes, recommended changes (some of which were accepted), and shared changes with other customer service representatives in meetings. However, the place that I truly shined was in finding solutions when there was no clear answer about things and resources were ambiguous. To me that is a key component for assisting clients who may be confused or frustrated. During my time with Citibank, I learned to address customersâ€™ concerns with what can sometimes feel like limited support - never blaming the company, and always acting as an advocate for the customer, and team player for the employer - so that everyone can be as satisfied as possible with the end result.
